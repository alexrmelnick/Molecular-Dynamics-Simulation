EC527 High Performance Programming with Multicore and GPUs Final Project: Molecular Dynamics Simulator with Cell Lists and Range-Limited Forces

## Project Overview

This project implements a 2-D molecular dynamics simulation of **liquid argon** using the **Lennard-Jones potential** for interatomic forces. There will be two versions of the simulation: a trivial O(N^2) version and an optimized O(N) version using cell lists. The simulation will be run on a CPU (both single-threaded and multi-threaded in **C** using **OpenMP**) and a GPU (using **CUDA**). Performance will be compared across these implementations, and the results will be visualized using **Python**.

## Usage

WIP but in the end you should be able to just run the makefile and generate the data.csv file, assuming you have OpenMP and CUDA installed. We may be compiling things manually in the meantime.

## File Structure

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| main.cu | Main file for running and timing all of the simulations. This is the file that outputs the results. |
| serial-trivial.c | Single-threaded implementation of the trivial O(N^2) version of the simulation. |
| parallel-trivial.c | Optimized multi-threaded implementation of the trivial O(N^2) version of the simulation using OpenMP. |
| GPU-trivial.cu | CUDA implementation of the trivial O(N^2) version of the simulation using CUDA. |
| serial-cell.c | Single-threaded implementation of the cell list O(N) version of the simulation. |
| parallel-cell.c | Optimized multi-threaded implementation of the cell list O(N) version of the simulation using OpenMP. |
| GPU-cell.cu | CUDA implementation of the cell list O(N) version of the simulation using CUDA. |
| common.h | Header file containing common functions and definitions used in all implementations. |
| trivial.h | Header file containing functions and definitions specific to the trivial O(N^2) implementation. |
| cell.h | Header file containing functions and definitions specific to the cell list O(N) implementation. |
| analysis.ipynb | Jupyter notebook for analyzing the results of the simulations. This includes plotting the results and comparing the performance of the different implementations. |
| data.csv | CSV file containing the results of the simulations. This file is generated by the main.cu file. |
